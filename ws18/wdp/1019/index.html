		<h1>PEANUTS</h1>
		<h2>what are peanuts?</h2>
		<p>Peanuts are small brown things that you can eat.
			Some people choke on them. But you should try to avoid that.
		</p>
		<h2>why are they important?</h2>
		<p>Life is fast and it's getting faster everyday. People don't have time to eat anymore.
		That's where peanuts come in. They save the day with being nutritous and still very small and portable.
